A prototype of Lantern running on nodejs.

Not much there right now except for a local proxy server.

To run:

`./compile.bash ; node lantern.js`

This starts a local proxy on port 8080 at which you can point your browser.

To build a tarball (just to see how big it is) you can run:

`./package.bash`
